```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE)


```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_light())
```


Now that we've practice a bit with ggplot, we're going to work on a few more plots with the `flights` dataset.


```{r}
avg_flight_delay
```



```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(origin, dest) %>% 
  summarise(average_arrival_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = origin, y = dest)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = average_arrival_delay)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("blue", "white", "red")) + 
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```
