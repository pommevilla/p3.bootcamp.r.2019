# P3 Programming Bootcamp: Introduction to R

## Introduction

### About this workshop

This workshop is broken up into 5 parts:

* [R Basics](later)
* [ggplot2 basics](later)
* [Exploratory data analysis](later)
* [Next steps](later)

You'll need to install the following packages to do this workshop: ggplot2, tidyverse, Rmarkdown, and reshape2. 

Copy and paste the following lines of code into your R console to download them all at once.

```{r}
reqs <- c("tidyverse", "reshape2", "rmarkdown")
missing_packages <- reqs[!(reqs %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) {
  install.packages(missing_packages)
}
```

### Why R?

Good for stats
Most commonly used by students in the biologies
Visualizations are great
Rmarkdown is nice
