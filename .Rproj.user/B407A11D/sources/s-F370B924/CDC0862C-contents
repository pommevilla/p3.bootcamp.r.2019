## Lesson 2: Getting started with ggplot2

R has a native function for plotting, but we're going to start learning about `ggplot`. `ggplot` offers more control and more    


Hadley Wickham, badass motherfucker, said in [A Layered Grammar of Graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf):

> A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. 

The `ggplot2` package is built around the idea of "building up a graphic from multiple layers of data."

### 

The function call for ggplot is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data, mapping = aes(...)) + 
  <geom_layers> + 
  <additional layers>
```

Here, each of the different objects represents a layer:

*`data` is the data object that you would like to visualize and `mapping` contains the aesthetic mappings to use; that is, the mapping of which aesthetics to which variables. 
*`geom_layers` are what actually draw the points onto the canvas; for example, `geom_point` will create a scatter plot. 
* There are additional layers you can use to make your graph prettier.

A `ggplot` call might look like:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Let's change the x- and y-axis titles to be a little more informative:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Weight (in thousands of lbs)",
       y = "Miles per gallon")
```

We can also introduce other aesthetics into the plot. For example, let's color the dots by the number of cylinders they have:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = cyl)) +
  labs(x = "Weight (in thousands of lbs)",
       y = "Miles per gallon")
```

We can also change the size of the points by setting `size` to a specific number:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = cyl), 
             size = 3) +
  labs(x = "Weight (in thousands of lbs)",
       y = "Miles per gallon")
```

And let's change a few more things to make the graph a bit prettier:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = cyl)) +
  labs(x = "Weight",
       y = "Miles per gallon",
       title = "Miles per gallon versus weight for automobiles",
       subtitle = "Data from Motor Trend magazine") + 
  theme_light()
```


#### Exercises 2.1

* What are some things we can do to improve the clarity and effectiveness of this graph? 
* What are conclusions you can draw from this graph? 
* Experiment with the color aesthetic by mapping it to different variables. Try mapping another variable to the `size` aesthetic (`qsec`, for instance).
* Use `?theme_light` and try out a few other themes.
